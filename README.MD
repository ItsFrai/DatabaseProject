Outline: The following code contains a file for student generator. Beyond that, there will be a file which is called Database Application. This file is what is used to showcase all the prompts to the user and what will be used to call each function method. In each part, the case function is used which goes into the file of each part and gets the value or values required to output to the user. Each part letter is associated with the same part on the HW assignment. 


Generation of Data : How the data was generated was by creating a java file which then contained a bunch of dummy variables from student names to courses, etc. On top of that, the file contains a bunch of for loops which use the random java util import to create random IDs in random orders.
